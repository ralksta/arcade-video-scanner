# Arcade Video Scanner 4.8 (Reliability Edition)

A professional-grade media management and video analysis tool designed for high-performance scanning and library maintenance.

## 🚀 Version 4.8 Highlights

### 🔒 Robust Vault Persistence
- **State Synchronization**: Videos moved to the **Vault** now stay there reliably across restarts.
- **Path Normalization**: Uses absolute path resolution to bridge the gap between file system representations and web browser requests.
- **Atomic Cache Updates**: Improved cache manager ensuring that your "reviewed" status is never lost during re-scans.
- **Diagnostic Logging**: Get real-time feedback in the terminal when the database is loaded or updated.

### 🌐 Smart Network Management
- **Auto-Port Detection**: The server intelligently finds the next available port if the default 8000 is occupied.
- **Socket Resilience**: Implemented `SO_REUSEADDR` to prevent the "Address already in use" errors during quick restarts.

### 🕹 Workspace Modes (Lobby vs. Vault)
- **Lobby**: A clean, focused workspace showing only active videos.
- **The Vault**: A dedicated archival view with a **Cyber Cyan** theme.

### 📦 Modular & Robust Architecture
- **Smart Seeking**: Adapts thumbnail extraction to video duration.
- **Auto-Repair**: Automatically detects and regenerates corrupted thumbnails.
- **Native Streaming**: Implementation of HTTP Range Requests for smooth playback.
- **Cinema Mode**: Premium video player with `ESC` to close functionality.
