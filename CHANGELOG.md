## [4.9.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- **UI Performance Optimization**: Implemented lazy loading and infinite scrolling for the video grid, significantly improving performance for large libraries (tested with 2200+ clips).
- **Robust Static Asset Serving**: Transitioned CSS and JavaScript from Python templates to dedicated static files (`/static/styles.css` and `/static/client.js`) with improved path resolution.
- **Auto-Port Detection**: The server now automatically finds the next available port if the default 8000 is occupied.
- **Address Reuse**: Implemented `SO_REUSEADDR` to prevent "Address already in use" errors during quick restarts.

### Changed
- Improved encoding handling for local configuration files (`local_targets.txt`, `local_excludes.txt`) using UTF-8 with BOM support.
- Updated dashboard template to use static asset links instead of inline/templated scripts and styles.
- Refactored server logic to keep the working directory at the project root for better resource management.

### Fixed
- Resolved Python syntax errors related to global variable declarations in `web_server.py`.
- Fixed asset loading issues (404 errors) by implementing more robust static file routing.
- General bug fixes and stability improvements.
