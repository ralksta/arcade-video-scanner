## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Keep `ROADMAP.md` as your source of truth
- Create GitHub issues for features you're actively working on
- Use labels to organize and filter issues
- Reference issues in commits: `git commit -m "Add dark theme (#4)"`
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` when features are completed

### ❌ DON'T:
- Create issues for every single idea (use ROADMAP.md for brainstorming)
- Forget to close issues when features are completed
- Let issues and ROADMAP.md get out of sync

---

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your roadmap is now:
- ✅ Documented in `ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ Tracked in GitHub Issues
- ✅ Organized with labels
- ✅ Ready for development

**Happy coding!** 🚀
